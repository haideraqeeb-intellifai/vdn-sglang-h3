# Video DeltaNet: Hybrid Attention to Speed Up Video Models with Near-Lossless Quality

[[`Blog`](https://openvdn.github.io/)] [[`Code`](https://github.com/OpenVDN/vdn-minimax-h3)] [[`🤗 Weights`](https://huggingface.co/OpenVDN/vdn-minimax-h3)] [[`ModelScope`](https://www.modelscope.ai/models/OpenVDN/vdn-minimax-h3)] [[`License`](#license)]

We release **VDN-Minimax-H3** (**VDN-H3**), a hybrid-attention model that generates video faster than it plays, powered by [MiniMax H3](https://huggingface.co/MiniMaxAI/MiniMax-H3). It offers these key features:

- **Fast inference:** With SGLang Diffusion on 8×B200 GPUs, VDN-H3 generates a 14.4-second clip in about **9.0 seconds end-to-end**, including **6.9 seconds for denoising**, using 8 denoising steps.
- **Hybrid Architecture:** We propose a hybrid-attention architecture: one frame-wise linear attention branch that is highly efficient, and a softmax branch that maintains the backbone's visual quality and consistency.
- **Plug-and-Play:** The checkpoint adds a separate linear attention branch and two small LoRA adapters that can be merged into the backbone during inference without touching the backbone weights.
- **Fully open-source:** We don't just open-source the weights. The optimized inference stack and its corresponding training code are released together.

This repository holds the weights. Read the [Blog](https://openvdn.github.io/) for the architecture, training method, benchmarks, and qualitative results. The inference and training code, together with the setup instructions, is available at [OpenVDN/vdn-minimax-h3](https://github.com/OpenVDN/vdn-minimax-h3).

## News

- **September 14, 2026:** [SGLang Diffusion](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang) now supports VDN-H3, achieving its fastest reported performance: 6.9 seconds for denoising and about 9.0 seconds end-to-end for a 14.4-second video on 8×B200 GPUs. See the [MiniMax-H3 cookbook](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/blob/main/docs/cookbook/diffusion/MiniMax/MiniMax-H3.mdx#7-vdn-h3-hybrid-attention-8-step-distill) for more details.
- **September 8, 2026:** We support I2VA, FL2VA and L2VA now with the same checkpoint.
- **September 6, 2026:** We released the [VDN-H3 blog](https://openvdn.github.io/), [training and inference code](https://github.com/OpenVDN/vdn-minimax-h3), and [model weights](https://huggingface.co/OpenVDN/vdn-minimax-h3).

## Set up the environment

**Before you begin**, please read the [license](#license) before downloading or running VDN-H3.

1. Clone the VDN-H3 repository from GitHub.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/OpenVDN/vdn-minimax-h3.git
cd vdn-minimax-h3
```

2. Create the environment. We recommend PyTorch 2.13 (`torch.__version__` = `2.13.0+cu129`) and installing FlashAttention 4: on Hopper and data-center Blackwell the window softmax runs on its kernels, through [FlexAttention's Flash backend](https://pytorch.org/blog/flexattention-flashattention-4-fast-and-flexible/) or directly. On Ampere, Ada and consumer Blackwell (RTX 50 series), or without it, the window softmax runs on FlexAttention's Triton kernel and on PyTorch's own varlen attention.

```bash
conda create -n vdn python=3.12 -y
conda activate vdn
pip install uv

uv pip install torch==2.13.0 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu129
```

3. Install the other packages shown in `pyproject.toml`, `flash-attn-4` included (`--prerelease=allow` is needed for its pre-release `nvidia-cutlass-dsl` dependency); on Ampere, Ada and consumer Blackwell neither it nor the regular `flash-attn` is used, as attention there runs on PyTorch's own kernels.

```bash
uv pip install --prerelease=allow -e .
```

4. Install the patched Diffusers. The setup script handles everything:

```bash
bash scripts/setup_diffusers.sh
```

## Inference with Diffusers

The quickest way to a first render is using diffusers, as we already release the checkpoints as modular diffusers components:

```python
import torch
from accelerate import cpu_offload_with_hook
from diffusers import ModularPipeline
from diffusers.hooks import apply_group_offloading

pipe = ModularPipeline.from_pretrained("OpenVDN/vdn-minimax-h3", workflow="t2va")
pipe.load_components(trust_remote_code=True, torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16)

apply_group_offloading(pipe.text_encoder, onload_device="cuda", offload_type="leaf_level",
                       use_stream=True)
_, vae = cpu_offload_with_hook(pipe.vae, execution_device="cuda")
cpu_offload_with_hook(pipe.audio_vae, execution_device="cuda", prev_module_hook=vae)
pipe.transformer.to("cuda")

out = pipe(prompt="a prompt", num_frames=345, num_inference_steps=9,
           output=["videos", "audio", "sampling_rate"])
```

`num_inference_steps` counts sigma grid points, so 9 of them is 8 model evaluations. [`infer_diffusers.py`](https://github.com/OpenVDN/vdn-minimax-h3/blob/main/src/inference/infer_diffusers.py) runs the same as a script, keyframes included.

On a 24 GB card, stream the transformer in one block at a time: swap `pipe.transformer.to("cuda")` for the line below, or add `--offload_dit` to the script. 345 frames then peak at 22 GB, 20 in fp8.

```python
apply_group_offloading(pipe.transformer, onload_device="cuda", offload_type="block_level",
                       num_blocks_per_group=1, use_stream=True)
```

The transformer can be offloaded per model or per block, but not per leaf. Its window softmax runs on FlexAttention; `softmax_backend={"transformer": "decomposed"}` in `load_components` selects the decomposition the code repository's own scripts use instead, FA4's varlen kernel on Hopper and data-center Blackwell and PyTorch's on Ampere, Ada and consumer Blackwell.

fp8 is torchao's (`pip install torchao`): `fp8={"transformer": True}` in `load_components`, or `--fp8` for the script, puts every wide Linear in fp8 e4m3, and a `quantization_config` of your own, a `TorchAoConfig`, is applied in its place after the LoRA merge.

## Inference with SGLang

[SGLang Diffusion](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang) provides native VDN-H3 serving for T2VA and FL2VA. Install SGLang and launch the 8×B200 configuration below. Set `--num-gpus` to 1, 2, or 4 for the corresponding smaller configuration:

```bash
uv pip install "sglang[diffusion]" --prerelease=allow

sglang serve \
  --model-path OpenVDN/vdn-minimax-h3 \
  --num-gpus 8 \
  --quantization fp8 \
  --attention-backend hybrid_window_attn_h3 \
  --performance-mode speed \
  --warmup-num-frames 345 \
  --warmup-resolutions 1344x768 \
  --port 30010
```

With MXFP8, denoising takes 47.6, 25.9, 13.1, and 6.9 seconds on 1, 2, 4, and 8 B200 GPUs, respectively. The 8-GPU configuration returns the finished 14.4-second video in about 9.0 seconds end-to-end after warm-up. See the [MiniMax-H3 cookbook](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/blob/main/docs/cookbook/diffusion/MiniMax/MiniMax-H3.mdx#7-vdn-h3-hybrid-attention-8-step-distill) for more details.

## Inference with our repository

### Download the weights

To render through the optimized stack instead -- fp8, the tuned kernels, and Ulysses across eight GPUs, which is where the numbers under [Results](#results) come from -- start from the [code repository](https://github.com/OpenVDN/vdn-minimax-h3) and download everything (about 82 GB) into `ckpts/` using

```bash
hf download OpenVDN/vdn-minimax-h3 --local-dir ckpts
```

or from [ModelScope](https://www.modelscope.ai/models/OpenVDN/vdn-minimax-h3) with

```bash
modelscope download --model OpenVDN/vdn-minimax-h3 --local_dir ckpts
```

The layout will look like

```text
ckpts/
  h3-base/             the released MiniMax-H3: transformer, video and audio VAEs, schedulers · 72 GB
  stage-b-step-2000/   VDN-H3-50-step: linear_branch/ + adapters/default/ LoRA · 4.3 GB
  stage-dmd-step-250/  VDN-H3-8-step: the above + adapters/turbo/ · 5.1 GB
```

`stage-dmd-step-250` is the 8-step model the headline numbers use; `stage-b-step-2000` is the 50-step model it is distilled from. Each directory describes itself: `model_spec.json` records the hybrid architecture, `metadata.json` the training recipe, and the learned tensors sit in `linear_branch/model.safetensors` and `adapters/<name>/adapter_model.safetensors`.

### Render a video

First clone and set up the [code repository](https://github.com/OpenVDN/vdn-minimax-h3#set-up-environment). Then, from the root of that repository, run the model on a single GPU:

```bash
bash scripts/inference/8nfe_tuned_fp8.sh
```

Note that the first run needs to compile all of the kernels, which might take several minutes. Later runs can reuse the cache.

### Use your own prompt

For your own prompt, you should first encode it using the Qwen3-VL-32B VLM, then render it through the main diffusion model:

```bash
python src/inference/encode_prompt.py --prompt "..." --out prompts/mine.pt

python src/inference/infer.py \
  --config configs/inference/8nfe_tuned_fp8.yaml \
  checkpoint=ckpts/stage-dmd-step-250 \
  render.prompt_file=prompts/mine.pt \
  render.out=results/mine.mp4
```

We strongly recommend rewriting it first using [H3-Context-IR](https://platform.minimax.io/docs/api-reference/video-generation-v2-h3-context-ir) or the official [prompt-writing skills](https://github.com/MiniMax-AI/MiniMax-H3/tree/main/skills) before encoding it. This can greatly improve the generated video quality.

### Supporting FL2VA, I2VA, and L2VA

The same checkpoints also generate from keyframes. We provide an FL2VA example in [`prompts/image/`](https://github.com/OpenVDN/vdn-minimax-h3/tree/main/prompts/image):

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenVDN/vdn-minimax-h3/main/prompts/image/first.png" alt="first keyframe"></td>
<td width="50%"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenVDN/vdn-minimax-h3/main/prompts/image/last.png" alt="last keyframe"></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center"><code>prompts/image/first.png</code></td>
<td align="center"><code>prompts/image/last.png</code></td>
</tr>
</table>

Render it with:

```bash
python src/inference/infer.py \
  --config configs/inference/8nfe_tuned_fp8.yaml \
  checkpoint=ckpts/stage-dmd-step-250 \
  render.prompt_file=prompts/image/example_fl2va.pt \
  render.out=results/example_fl2va.mp4
```

For your own keyframes, encode the prompt together with the images first:

```bash
python src/inference/encode_keyframes.py --prompt "..." \
  --first first.png --last last.png --out prompts/image/mine.pt
```

`--first` alone is I2VA, `--last` alone is L2VA, and both is FL2VA. Each mode wants its own instruction as the prompt's first line, given by MiniMax-H3's [prompt writing guide](https://huggingface.co/MiniMaxAI/MiniMax-H3/blob/main/docs/VIDEO_PROMPT_WRITING_GUIDE_base_en.md).

### Choosing an inference configuration

We support both single-GPU and multi-GPU inference for the released model. Single-GPU scripts auto-detect the best kernels for your GPU. Multi-GPU scripts vary by hardware:

```bash
bash scripts/inference/8nfe_tuned_fp8.sh                # one GPU
bash scripts/inference/8nfe_tuned_fp8_ulysses_h200.sh   # eight H200s, one node
bash scripts/inference/8nfe_tuned_fp8_ulysses_b200.sh   # eight B200s, one node
```

## Results

Our fastest reported result uses SGLang Diffusion on 8×B200 GPUs: 6.9 seconds for denoising and about 9.0 seconds end-to-end for a 768p, 14.4-second video. The tables below compare its steady-state denoising speed with our reference inference pipeline on H200s and B200s:

**H200:**

| Configuration | GPUs | Seconds/NFE | 50 NFE (VDN-H3-50-step) | 8 NFE (VDN-H3-8-step) |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| dense MiniMax-H3 | 1 | 32.7 | 27.3 min | 4.4 min |
| VDN-H3 FP8 | 1 | 11.2 | 9.4 min | 90.5 s |
| VDN-H3 FP8 Distributed | 8 | 2.29 | 1.9 min | 18.3 s |

**B200:**

| Configuration | GPUs | Seconds/NFE | 50 NFE (VDN-H3-50-step) | 8 NFE (VDN-H3-8-step) |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| dense MiniMax-H3 (cuDNN) | 1 | 16.74 | 13.95 min | 2.23 min |
| VDN-H3 FP8 | 1 | 6.41 | 5.3 min | 51 s |
| VDN-H3 FP8 Distributed | 8 | 1.40 | 1.2 min | 11.23 s |
| SGLang Diffusion, VDN-H3 FP8 Distributed | 8 | **0.88** | **44.0 s** | **6.9 s** |

We exclude model loading, warm-up, VAE decoding, and MP4 encoding. For a live setup, we recommend running the text prompt rewriter, VAE decoding, and MP4 conversion on separate machines, so the eight GPUs only perform denoising.
